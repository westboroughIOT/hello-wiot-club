Connect your club approved microcontroller to the internet.  Send a signal to our webserver showing that your mircocontroller exists.

## Purpose
All of our current and future projects at Westborough IOT involve connecting to the internet.  This project sets the general model (file structure, hardware, etc) we plan to use in other projects.  This particular project is the simple program of "Hello World".  If you are new to the group or plan on contributing, this will be the perfect place to start.

## Approved microcontrollers
* ESPDuino
* Arduino Uno with Esp8266 Module

## How to use
