Connect your club approved microcontroller to the internet.  Send a signal to our webserver showing that your mircocontroller exists.

## Purpose
All of our current and future projects at Westborough IOT seem to involve connecting to the internet. It would be great to document details on how to get one of the most common tasks accomplished, "the device communicating to a network".

## Approved microcontrollers
* ESPDuino
* Arduino Uno with Esp8266 Module
